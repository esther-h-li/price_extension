A Chrome extension designed to reduce impulse purchases by giving users price context instead of urgency-driven pressure.

Many online stores use subtle urgency tactics (countdowns, low-stock warnings, dynamic pricing) that rush users into buying.
Impulse Price Checker surfaces historical pricing, alternative listings, and urgency signals so users can make calmer, better-informed decisions.
